## More About me

Passionate software developer  who have been in front of a computer since I was 14 years old, assembling and disassembling things. I like the idea of being able to create, share and learn in a world without borders. And for this I think it is important that knowledge on the internet is for everyone, that our rights, privacy and freedoms are respected, and that there is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fsf.org/" >free software</a>.

And I'm not just 0's and 1's. I also like other things like playing chess, soccer and spending time connecting with nature.

## About my Stack

Ruby on Rails offers numerous advantages for web development. This open source framework, based on the Ruby programming language, has gained great popularity due to its focus on simplicity and productivity. Especially for developing projects in a fast, scalable and secure way.

Working with AWS (Amazon Web Services) offers the advantage of a highly scalable and elastic cloud infrastructure. You can quickly adjust compute, storage and network resources according to your application needs. With automated tools and services, AWS simplifies scalability management, ensuring optimal performance for your application at all times.

The synergy between Ruby on Rails and AWS is an excellent choice for developing web applications. Rails provides an agile development framework, while AWS offers a scalable cloud infrastructure. Together, they provide a reliable and flexible platform for building and scaling web applications efficiently, ensuring optimal performance and an exceptional user experience.

These two tools are an important part of my stack but they are not the only ones. I am constantly developing Python scripts, researching GNU/Linux distributions and learning new technologies. Keeping updated and being aware of the latest trends is essential to provide innovative and efficient solutions.
